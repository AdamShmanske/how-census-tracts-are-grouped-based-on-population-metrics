# How census tracts are grouped in Baltimore City based on individual income, household income, incarceration rate, and employment rate?

## Background

Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs and Lorraine Mirabella [published an article](baltimoresun.com/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-choice-neighborhoods-hud-grant-20180719-story.html) on _The Baltimore Sun_ approximately two years ago about how Baltimore City's $889  million plan to transform "a swath of East Baltimore" was awarded $30 million federal grant, which included tearing down Perkins Homes public housing and moving residents to new housing. As they made new housing guaranteed, the city was optimistic about the redevelopment. As this is the right direction and had an optimistic start to "create the new mixed-income community" with projects that include "a new school, parks and services to help families and job-seekers, and officials", how are different neighborhoods grouped in Baltimore City? We will analyze the data from [Opportunity Atlas](https://www.opportunityatlas.org) to further look into how different parts of the city are grouped based on different population metrics.

    iv. Employment Rate: Fraction of who grew up in this area have positive wage earnings

## Data Question - Metrics

We will use Microsoft Excel to answer:

- __How are different tracts clustered based on the four variables?__ Applying Excel Solver operations for a cluster analysis on a database that is constructed with variable z-scores, and cluster categories.
